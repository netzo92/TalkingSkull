# Frontend Guidelines

- Use React with functional components and hooks.
- Keep LiveKit-related configuration in dedicated helper modules.
- Type all props and state; avoid using `any`.
- Use named exports where possible; default exports are acceptable for React components.
- Ensure network requests are isolated in utility functions.
- Landing page sections should remain accessible with semantic headings and anchor-based navigation.
- When updating the marketing experience, align colors and typography with the gradients defined in `src/styles.css`.
