# Repository Guidelines

- Prefer TypeScript for frontend React code and FastAPI for backend services.
- Keep configuration and infrastructure definitions in dedicated folders (e.g. `gcp/`).
- Write descriptive comments for complex logic but keep components lean and functional.
- When adding environment variables, document them in the README and provide `.example` files where appropriate.
- Formatting: use 2-space indentation for YAML and JSON, and follow Prettier defaults for frontend code.
